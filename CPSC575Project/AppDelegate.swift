/*
The AppDelegate will be responsible for the application lifecycle and setup.
The main point of entry for an application.

    3 main functions:
    1. func application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) -> Bool
    2. func application(_:configurationForConnecting:options:) -> UISceneConfiguration
    3. func application(_:didDiscardSceneSessions:)
 
AppDelegate can still handle the external services like push notification registrations, location services, app termination and more.
